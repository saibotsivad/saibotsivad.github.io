## Philosophy

* I care about code being simple, and I care about quality.
* I want the UX to be carefully designed, beautiful, and maintainable.
* I am passionate about learning, and about making useful things.

## Professional Experience

### Web Developer at [From Now On](http://from-now-on.com/#home) (Omaha, NE): September 2016-Current

* I just started!

* Designed custom document parsing software to pull out and aggregate
	data from third-party emails.

	of rows, writing efficient queries to QA the data and to

	applications and user facing, primarily with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
	and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
* Personally responsible for two major upgrades of third-party
	libraries (Bootstrap `2.2 => 3.3`, and AngularJS `1.1 => 1.3`).

	Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft/Outlook, along with a careful test suite.

	email delivery parameters for several brands (e.g. Walmart vs Best Buy).

## Personal Projects

Outside of work hours I build modules and websites, exploring
new technology primarily in the JavaScript/npm world. A few
things I've made that I am pretty happy with are:

* [hex2words](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hex2words): Given a
	hexadecimal value, it returns a list of PGP Words. This is
	a list of words two users can read to verify they have identical
	signatures, for example.
* [json-schema-to-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-schema-to-markdown):
	Turn a JSON schema (a JSON object used to validate other JSON objects)
	into a human-readable markdown file. It makes writing documentation
	a lot easier.
* [pipe-transform-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pipe-transform-cli):
	A command line utility I wrote that lets you stream in one encoding
	and stream out another encoding. For example, hex in and base64 out.

## Professional Skills/Interests:

* Experience with the popular operating systems: Ubuntu, Windows, Mac, and Linux in general. Also familiar in passing with Docker, and would love reasons to dive deeper.
* Proficiency and familiarity with several programming languages--Javascript, Perl, HTML/CSS, PHP, Java.
* Publishing small, reusable code, so that long-term maintenance is easier.
* Familiar with modeling software such as AutoCAD, Autodesk, SolidWorks, progeCAD, etc.
* Experienced audio technician, and reasonable with general electronics repair.
* Was part of the [University Mini Baja group](http://engineering.unl.edu/mme/mme-baja-sae-husker-racing/), researching viability of a hydrostatic transmission design.
* Vehicle repair technician, engine rebuilds.
* Enjoys a good cigar and a glass of scotch on occasion.
