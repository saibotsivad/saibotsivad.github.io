## Philosophy

* I care about code being simple, and I care about quality.
* I want the UX to be carefully designed, beautiful, and maintainable.
* I am passionate about learning, and about making useful things.

## Professional Experience

### Web Developer at [From Now On](http://from-now-on.com/) (Omaha, NE): September 2016-Present

* Designing and maintaining client-facing webapp interfaces for
	a content-management system.
* Architecture-level design, and continued maintenance of various
	servers and services.
* Inherited a large and mostly untested code base, introducing
	automated testing on pull requests, linting code as part of
	the test suite, and code styles which lowered regression
	issues and bug counts.
* Building and maintaining API services that interface with
	third-party services, cleaning and normalizing inconsistent data.
* As a full-stack engineer in a small startup company, I do
	sys-ops level work, creating and maintaining systems in the
	Azure and AWS environments.
* Currently the lead webapp engineer and lead JavaScript engineer.
* Currently balancing my workload between building new features
	and migrating old, buggy code in a safe and tested manner.

### Software Engineer at [eDataSource](http://www.edatasource.com/) (New York, NY): May 2012-September 2016

* Designed custom document parsing software to pull out and aggregate
	data from third-party emails.
* Regularly work with MySQL database tables containing millions
	of rows, writing efficient queries to QA the data and to
	generate custom reports for clients.
* Have written many large pieces for several websites, both business
	applications and user facing, primarily with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
	and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
* Personally responsible for two major upgrades of third-party
	libraries (Bootstrap `2.2 => 3.3`, and AngularJS `1.1 => 1.3`).
* Designed the layout and full UI for a new website section which
	helps clients test email campaigns prior to sending them to users.
* With a team of 2-4, redesigned the website and server for [Boxbe](http://www.boxbe.com),
	a site serving over a million active users, and visited by
	thousands of unique visitors per day.
* Implemented and wrote code for client and server side of OAuth flow for
	Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft/Outlook, along with a careful test suite.
* With a team of 3-6, designed a new website section using several
	graphs and difficult queries, which helps our clients compare
	email delivery parameters for several brands (e.g. Walmart vs Best Buy).

### Prior to Software

#### Engineering Intern at Omaha Public Power District, Nuclear Facility (Fort Calhoun, NE): May 2011-December 2011

* Assisted engineers with sketches and drafts through engineering/drafting process.
* Maintained flood mitigation equipment during major flooding event.

#### Repair/Refurbishing Technician at Linweld Inc. (Waverly, NE 68507): May 2008-October 2008

* Repaired and refurbished welding and medical gas cylinders.
* Performed quality control inspections during stages of repair.
* Routinely installed and tested gas delivery fittings.

* Designed operational budget which cut costs significantly.

## Personal Projects

Outside of work hours I build modules and websites, exploring
new technology primarily in the JavaScript/npm world. A few
things I've made that I am pretty happy with are:

* [hex2words](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hex2words): Given a
	hexadecimal value, it returns a list of PGP Words. This is
	a list of words two users can read to verify they have identical
	signatures, for example.
* [json-schema-to-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-schema-to-markdown):
	Turn a JSON schema (a JSON object used to validate other JSON objects)
	into a human-readable markdown file. It makes writing documentation
	a lot easier.
* [pipe-transform-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pipe-transform-cli):
	A command line utility I wrote that lets you stream in one encoding
	and stream out another encoding. For example, hex in and base64 out.

## Professional Skills/Interests:

* Experience with the popular operating systems: Ubuntu, Windows, Mac, and Linux in general. Also familiar in passing with Docker, and would love reasons to dive deeper.
* Proficiency and familiarity with several programming languages--Javascript, Perl, HTML/CSS, PHP, Java.
* Publishing small, reusable code, so that long-term maintenance is easier.
* Familiar with modeling software such as AutoCAD, Autodesk, SolidWorks, progeCAD, etc.
* Experienced audio technician, and reasonable with general electronics repair.
* Was part of the [University Mini Baja group](http://engineering.unl.edu/mme/mme-baja-sae-husker-racing/), researching viability of a hydrostatic transmission design.
* Vehicle repair technician, engine rebuilds.
* Enjoys a good cigar and a glass of scotch on occasion.

## Familiar Technology

While working at eDataSource, I've built things using:

	Babel (ES6 to ES5 mostly), PreCSS, PostCSS, LESS, JS, HTML, CSS,
	XML, Socket.io, Moment.js, jQuery, ACE (web code editor).

contributed to ngbp (AngularJS boilerplate), Noddity, and recently
PhantomJS. Comfortable in most operating Systems: Windows, Mac, Ubuntu, Debian.
